    <p>Uncle Iroh, from "<cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender">Avatar: The Last Airbender</a></cite>," is a wise, compassionate, and jovial former Fire Nation general who becomes a mentor to his hot-headed nephew, Prince Zuko. Renowned for his profound wisdom, spiritual insight, and love for tea, Iroh's past is marked by both triumph and tragedy, leading him to value peace over power.
